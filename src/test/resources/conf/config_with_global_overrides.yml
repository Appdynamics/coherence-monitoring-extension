#This will create it in specific Tier aka Component. Replace <COMPONENT_ID> with actual component Id.

        - CacheHits : "CacheHits" #The rough number of cache hits since the last time statistics were reset. A cache hit is a read operation invocation (that is, get()) for which an entry exists in this map.
        - CacheMisses : "CacheMisses" #The rough number of cache misses since the last time statistics were reset.
        - CachePrunes : "CachePrunes" #The number of prune operations since the last time statistics were reset. A prune operation occurs every time the cache reaches its high watermark as specified by the HighUnits attribute.
        - TotalGets : "TotalGets" #The total number of get() operations since the last time statistics were reset.
        - TotalPuts : "TotalPuts" #The total number of put() operations since the last time statistics were reset.
        - UnitFactor : "UnitFactor" #The factor by which the Units, LowUnits and HighUnits properties are adjusted. Using a BINARY unit calculator, for example, the factor of 1048576 could be used to count megabytes instead of bytes.
        - Units : "Units" #The size of the cache measured in units. This value needs to be adjusted by the UnitFactor.
        - Size : "Size" #The number of entries in the cache.
